Weather Forecast


SKYCAST

snackbar to tell put on location

notification to visit the app after 12 , 24 hrs and be counting
e.g it's been 2 days 3 days check the weather for tomorrow 

tomorrow in ibadan: Scattered thunderstorm
36°/26° See full forecast icon beside it

expect rain by 6pm icon beside it

push notifications from a server(back4app)

create a notification detail
show it when location is clicked on (just a little popup like an alert)

static app when data is not on as entering the app it will not load after being on probably add a reload button

thinking of creating animation between main and days fragments

thinking of creating different layouts allowing users to switch their layout
dropdown layout in days fragment for each hour of the day on each day
notifications to send alerts on rain
create widgets 
add animations
diff layout for night & day mode
detail fragment the sun should be moving every hour at night it turns to moon

save data gotten to room db while waiting or internet

use workmanager and coroutines to reduce work on the main thread of the app (Dispacthers.IO and sum)

such as starting a service once a day to download a weather forecast. for the notification

fix
notification dosen't work until restart

when users click on notification is should show a customized alert dialog with the details

downloading the json response with downloadmanager

last but not least responsiveness
